Created for Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program - second project: Landing Page

### Live: [Florist's Shop Landing Page](https://maknetaro.github.io/landing-page/index.html)

Project made with HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript. I built dynamical navbar and added some animation on scroll to show the active section.
